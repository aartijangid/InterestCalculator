## Interest Calculator

A bank wants to introduce a new bank account with variable rates of interest depending
on how much money is in the account.

The interest rate bands are as follows:
  ``` 
  €0 to €1000     :1%
  €1000 to €5000  : 2%
  €5000+          : 3% 
  ```

For example: how much interest should I receive if I have €500 in the account (the
answer is €5, i.e. 1% of €500).
